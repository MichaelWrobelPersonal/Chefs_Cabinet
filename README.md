# About the Theme

This project is themed around making healthy eating easy and affordable.   We also wanted to make a site that would have broad appeal.
From the technical aspects of the site, we wanted to keep the user interface very easy and user friendly.  The source of the recipes is excelent and for those not interesting in cooking that night, Google maps gives them great options for local eateries.
